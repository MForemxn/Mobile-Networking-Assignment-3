---

## ✅ **Step 2: While Waiting for Hardware (Tomorrow)**

**Install Software:**
```bash
# Arduino IDE
Download from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

# Python dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
```

**Read Documentation:**
1. `QUICK_START.md` - Setup overview
2. `CV2X_LORA_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - How it works
3. `PRESENTATION_SCRIPT.md` - What to say

**Test Software Only:**
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
python3 main.py

# Start frontend
cd frontend
npm start

# Open http://localhost:3000 on multiple devices
# Test WebSocket functionality works
```

---

## ✅ **Step 3: Hardware Arrives (2-3 Days Later)**

**Read:** `CV2X_LORA_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Wiring section

**Upload Firmware:**

**Emergency Vehicle (10 minutes):**
1. Open `arduino_cv2x_emergency.ino`
2. Install LoRa library (Tools → Manage Libraries → "LoRa")
3. Connect Arduino via USB
4. Upload ✅

**Gateway (15 minutes):**
1. Open `esp32_lora_gateway.ino`
2. Edit lines 35-40: Add YOUR WiFi name/password and laptop IP
3. Install libraries: LoRa, WebSockets, U8g2
4. Upload to TTGO ✅

**Test Radio Link:**
- Press button on Arduino
- Watch gateway OLED display show "RX: 1"
- Check Serial Monitor shows "LoRa RX: BSM|EMG-001|EMERGENCY|..."
- ✅ Radio works!

---

## ✅ **Step 4: Full System Test (Evening Before Demo)**

**Complete Integration Test:**

1. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 main.py
   ```
   Look for: "✅ Server started successfully"

2. **Start Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   Opens at: http://localhost:3000

3. **Find Your IP:**
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```
   Example: 192.168.1.42

4. **Update Gateway:**
   - Edit esp32_lora_gateway.ino line 38
   - Change to your laptop IP
   - Re-upload to TTGO

5. **Test with 3 Devices:**
   - Your phone
   - Your tablet/second device
   - Friend's phone

6. **Press Button:**
   - Arduino transmits
   - Gateway receives (shows on OLED)
   - Server logs "C-V2X emergency received"
   - All 3 devices update
   - ✅ **IT WORKS!**

---

## ✅ **Step 5: Demo Day (Morning Of)**

**Read:** `PRESENTATION_SCRIPT.md`

**Setup (15 minutes before class):**
1. Charge laptop fully
2. Start backend server
3. Start frontend  
4. Verify gateway connected (check OLED)
5. Test with your phone
6. Write URL on board or prepare QR code
7. Deep breath - you're ready! 🎯

**During Demo:**
1. Students join URL
2. Show vehicles appearing
3. Explain C-V2X technology (2 min)
4. Press button → all vehicles move
5. Watch class reactions 🤯
6. Answer questions
7. Receive applause 👏
