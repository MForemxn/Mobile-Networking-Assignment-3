```

### **On Your Phone:**
```
1. Connect to SAME WiFi as computer
2. Open browser
3. Visit: http://YOUR_IP:3000
4. Should see highway demo
5. Try lane control buttons
6. Switch to traffic: http://YOUR_IP:3000?mode=traffic
```

### **Test Emergency on Phone:**
```
1. Phone connected to highway mode
2. Press 'E' in simulator
3. Phone should show:
   - Controls lock
   - Emergency banner
   - Vehicle moves right
4. Press 'C' in simulator
5. Phone should:

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Fixes**

### **"Connection failed" in simulator:**
```
Problem: Backend not running
Fix: Start backend first (Terminal 1)

Problem: Wrong port
Fix: Check backend is on port 8765
```

### **Tabs don't connect:**
```
Problem: Frontend not running
Fix: npm start in frontend/

Problem: Wrong URL
Fix: Use http://localhost:3000 (not https)
```

### **Emergency doesn't lock controls:**
```
Problem: Frontend not handling takeover message
Fix: Check browser console for errors
     Refresh page and try again
```

### **Traffic grid doesn't load:**
```
Problem: Wrong URL
Fix: Use ?mode=traffic query parameter
     Example: http://localhost:3000?mode=traffic
```

---

## 💡 **Advanced Testing**

### **Test with Many Devices:**

**Script to open multiple tabs:**
```bash
# Mac/Linux
for i in {1..10}; do
  open http://localhost:3000
  sleep 0.5
done

# Or manually: Ctrl+T (new tab) × 10
```

### **Test Emergency Under Load:**
```
1. Open 10-15 tabs
2. Randomly click lane buttons in different tabs
3. Press 'E' while vehicles are moving
4. Verify ALL tabs lock immediately
5. Press 'C'
6. Verify ALL tabs unlock
```

**✅ If this works with 10-15 tabs:** You can handle 30+ students!
