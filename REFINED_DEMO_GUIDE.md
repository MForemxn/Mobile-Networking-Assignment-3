## 🎭 **Demo Flow**

### **Part 1: Highway Demo with Manual Driving (5 minutes)**

**1. Students Connect (1 min):**
```
You: "Everyone open this URL on your phones..."
[Display QR code or write on board]

Students join → vehicles appear on shared highway
Terminal shows: "Device registered: abc123 | Total vehicles: 15"
```

**2. Interactive Driving (2 min):**
```
You: "Try the lane control buttons - drive your vehicle around"

Students press Left/Middle/Right buttons
Everyone sees all vehicles moving in real-time
Let them play for 30 seconds

You: "Notice everyone can see everyone else's vehicle. 
      This simulates all vehicles on the highway being 
      connected via C-V2X network mode."
```

**3. Emergency Takeover (2 min):**
```
You: "Now for the emergency demonstration. This Arduino"
[Hold up transmitter]
"broadcasts a C-V2X emergency signal via LoRa radio at 915 MHz.
This receiver"
[Point to TTGO with LED]
"will receive the signal and prove RF communication is working.

Watch this LED carefully. When I press the button..."
[PRESS BUTTON]

LED LIGHTS UP! 🔴
OLED shows: "EMERGENCY!"
Terminal logs: "🚨 RF EMERGENCY DETECTED VIA LORA!"

"Notice the LED is ON - that's radio frequency communication!
Now watch your phones..."

ALL student screens:
- Show "🔒 Control Locked (Emergency)"
- Buttons become disabled
- Vehicles automatically move to right lane
- Red emergency banner appears

"Your controls are locked. The system has taken over to clear
the path for the emergency vehicle. This is emergency preemption."

[Wait 5 seconds]
[PRESS BUTTON AGAIN]

LED turns OFF
OLED shows: "Clear"
Student screens:
- "Control Locked" changes to "🚗 Drive Your Vehicle"  
- Buttons re-enable
- Emergency banner disappears

"And control is returned to you. Drive safely!"
```

---

### **Part 2: Traffic Signal Preemption (Bonus - 3 minutes)**

**1. Switch Modes (30 sec):**
```
You: "Let me show you another application of C-V2X.
      Refresh your browsers but add ?mode=traffic to the URL"

Students visit: http://YOUR_IP:3000?mode=traffic

Now they see: 5x5 grid of intersections with traffic lights
```

**2. Explain Traffic Grid (1 min):**
```
You: "Each intersection has traffic lights cycling normally.
      The ambulance is here [point to 🚑 emoji on grid].
      
      In real C-V2X deployments, traffic lights receive emergency
      vehicle broadcasts and create a 'green wave' - coordinated
      green lights along the ambulance route so it doesn't have 
      to stop."
```

**3. Demo Green Wave (1.5 min):**
```
You: "Watch the traffic lights when I press the emergency button..."

[PRESS BUTTON]

LED lights (RF proof!)
Lights on ambulance's path turn GREEN
Lights perpendicular turn RED
Ambulance can drive straight through

[Use arrow keys or host interface to move ambulance]

Green lights move ahead of ambulance
Creates continuous path
No stops needed!

"This is how modern emergency vehicles could get through cities
faster and safer using C-V2X signal preemption."
```

## 🔊 **Presentation Narrative**

### **Opening:**
> "What you're about to see is C-V2X - Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything - the technology that's being deployed in production vehicles RIGHT NOW by GM, Ford, and Volkswagen.
> 
> Everyone, please join this demo on your phones. You're going to be vehicles on a shared highway, and you'll be able to drive your own vehicle using the controls."

### **During Manual Driving:**
> "Go ahead, try changing lanes. Notice you can see everyone else's vehicles too. This simulates the V2N mode of C-V2X - vehicles communicating through network infrastructure.
> 
> In production, this uses 4G or 5G. We're using WiFi and WebSockets, but the coordination principle is identical."

### **Emergency Demonstration:**
> "Now I'm going to show you the direct communication mode - V2V.
> 
> This Arduino has a LoRa radio that broadcasts emergency signals. When I press this button, it transmits at 915 MHz. This receiver [show TTGO] will pick up that radio signal.
> 
> Watch this LED - it will light up when it receives the transmission. That's your proof that wireless RF communication is happening."

**[PRESS BUTTON]**

> "There! LED is lit. That means the receiver got the radio broadcast. Now watch your screens..."

**[Students' controls lock and vehicles move]**

> "Notice your controls are locked - you can't change lanes. The emergency vehicle has priority, and the system has taken over to clear the path. This is emergency preemption.
> 
> In a real scenario, C-V2X would work the same way: emergency vehicle broadcasts, other vehicles detect it within 300-1000 meters, and their automated systems respond - or alert the driver to yield."

### **Traffic Grid Demo:**
> "Let me show you another application. Switch to the traffic mode...
> 
> This shows a city grid with 25 intersections. Normally, traffic lights cycle independently. But when the emergency vehicle broadcasts via C-V2X, the traffic lights receive that signal through Roadside Units and coordinate to create a 'green wave'.
> 
> Watch what happens when I activate the emergency..."

**[PRESS BUTTON]**

> "See how the lights on the ambulance's path turn green? This is called Signal Phase and Timing preemption - SPaT. The ambulance can drive straight through without stopping.
> 
> Cities are deploying this NOW. Denver, New York, Tampa - they're installing C-V2X-enabled traffic lights this year."

## 🎯 **Key Talking Points**

### **When Showing Hardware:**
> "This Arduino transmitter sends LoRa radio signals at 915 MHz. In production C-V2X, this would be 5.9 GHz. Same principle, different frequency - because actual C-V2X radios cost $500 each and require FCC certification."

### **When LED Lights:**
> "See that? That's electromagnetic radiation traveling through the air from this device to that one. No WiFi, no cellular, no wires. Pure radio frequency communication. This proves the wireless link is working."

### **During Takeover:**
> "Your controls are now locked. The system has priority. This demonstrates how C-V2X enables emergency vehicles to coordinate with traffic automatically. In the future, your car's autonomous system would respond to this signal and move over - even if you're not paying attention."

### **Traffic Grid:**
> "Traffic signal preemption using C-V2X is being deployed in several US cities right now. When an emergency vehicle approaches, the RSU at the intersection receives its C-V2X broadcast and changes the lights to green. The ambulance doesn't have to slow down, saving precious seconds that can save lives."

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **LED Doesn't Light:**
```
Check:
1. Arduino transmitter powered?
2. Both devices on same frequency? (915 vs 868 MHz)
3. Antennas connected?
4. Serial Monitor shows LoRa init success?

Debug:
- Open Serial Monitor on receiver (115200 baud)
- Should see "LoRa RX: BSM|..." when button pressed
- Check RSSI value (should be -40 to -100 dBm)
```

### **Students Can't Connect:**
```
Check:
1. Same WiFi network?
2. Firewall blocking port 8765?
3. Backend server running?
4. Correct IP address?

Debug:
- Test with YOUR phone first
- Check terminal for connection logs
- Verify frontend compiled (port 3000)
```

### **Controls Don't Lock:**
```
Check:
1. Receiver sending "EMERGENCY_DETECTED"?
2. Backend reading serial port?
3. WebSocket broadcasting "emergency_takeover"?
4. Frontend handling takeover message?

Debug:
- Check terminal logs for "TAKEOVER MODE ACTIVATED"
- Browser console for "Control locked" message
```
