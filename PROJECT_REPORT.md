## Executive Summary

This project presents a novel implementation of emergency vehicle preemption using Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) communication principles, demonstrated through Long Range (LoRa) radio technology as a practical, cost-effective alternative. The system enables emergency vehicles to broadcast their status directly to surrounding vehicles, which automatically respond by clearing traffic lanes—a critical application of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) that could save lives and reduce emergency response times. Our implementation combines physical radio hardware (Arduino + LoRa), network infrastructure (WebSocket server), and interactive visualization to demonstrate real-world V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure) communication patterns. The system successfully validates C-V2X concepts at less than 10% of the cost of commercial C-V2X hardware, making it ideal for research and educational purposes while maintaining functional equivalence for emergency signaling applications.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Road traffic accidents remain one of the leading causes of death globally, with the World Health Organization reporting approximately 1.35 million fatalities annually [1]. Emergency response time is critical—studies show that reducing emergency medical service (EMS) response time by just one minute can increase survival rates by up to 24% in cardiac arrest cases [2]. However, emergency vehicles frequently encounter traffic congestion, which delays their arrival at critical incidents.

Traditional emergency vehicle notification systems rely on sirens and visual signals, which have limited range (typically 30-50 meters in urban environments) and require line-of-sight. These systems cannot provide advance warning to drivers ahead of the emergency vehicle, particularly in heavy traffic or around corners. Additionally, modern vehicles with improved sound insulation and in-cabin entertainment systems make auditory warnings less effective [3].

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) offer a technological solution through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, enabling vehicles to exchange information wirelessly. C-V2X, standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), represents the next evolution in vehicular communication, offering superior range, reliability, and integration with existing cellular infrastructure compared to its predecessor, Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) [4].

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Despite the proven benefits of V2X technology for emergency vehicle preemption, widespread adoption faces several challenges:

1. **High Implementation Costs**: Commercial C-V2X modules cost $200-800 per unit, creating barriers for research institutions and developing regions
2. **Infrastructure Requirements**: Full C-V2X deployment requires roadside units (RSUs) and cellular network integration
3. **Standardization Delays**: Ongoing debates between C-V2X and DSRC have slowed regulatory approval and deployment
4. **Educational Gaps**: Limited access to affordable V2X hardware hinders hands-on learning opportunities for students and researchers

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This project addresses these challenges through the following objectives:

1. **Demonstrate C-V2X Principles**: Implement a functional emergency vehicle preemption system that accurately represents C-V2X direct communication (PC5 mode)
2. **Cost-Effective Alternative**: Utilize LoRa technology to achieve similar functionality at <10% of commercial C-V2X costs
3. **Validate Performance**: Measure system latency, range, and reliability against C-V2X specifications
4. **Educational Impact**: Create an interactive demonstration suitable for classroom use and public awareness campaigns
5. **Scalability Assessment**: Evaluate the system's potential for real-world deployment scenarios

### 1.4 Contributions

Our work makes the following contributions to mobile networking research and education:

- **Novel Architecture**: A hybrid system combining direct radio communication (LoRa) with network infrastructure (WebSocket) to simulate both C-V2X PC5 and Uu modes
- **Open-Source Implementation**: Complete hardware designs, firmware, and software available for replication and extension
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Empirical comparison of LoRa vs. C-V2X specifications for emergency messaging applications
- **Practical Deployment Framework**: Guidelines for implementing V2X-based emergency preemption in resource-constrained environments

## 2. Literature Review and Technology Background

### 2.1 Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication

V2X communication encompasses several sub-categories:

- **V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle)**: Direct communication between vehicles for collision avoidance, cooperative awareness, and platooning [5]
- **V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure)**: Communication with roadside units for traffic management and signal optimization [6]
- **V2P (Vehicle-to-Pedestrian)**: Safety warnings for vulnerable road users via smartphone applications [7]
- **V2N (Vehicle-to-Network)**: Cloud connectivity for traffic optimization, over-the-air updates, and navigation services [8]

The evolution of V2X technology has progressed through several generations:

1. **DSRC/IEEE 802.11p (2004-2019)**: Initial wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE) standard, operating at 5.9 GHz with range up to 300m and latency <50ms [9]. Adopted by early deployers but suffered from limited market penetration and infrastructure investment.

2. **C-V2X Release 14 (2017)**: LTE-based V2X with two operational modes: PC5 for direct communication and Uu for network-based services. Demonstrated superior non-line-of-sight performance and 2x range extension compared to DSRC [10].

3. **C-V2X Release 16 (2020)**: 5G New Radio (NR)-V2X supporting advanced use cases including autonomous driving, cooperative perception, and remote driving with latency <10ms and reliability >99.999% [11].

### 2.2 Emergency Vehicle Preemption Systems

Emergency vehicle preemption (EVP) has been studied extensively in the context of traffic signal control. Traditional optical-based systems (Opticom) use infrared emitters but suffer from weather sensitivity and limited range [12]. GPS-based priority systems improve reliability but require extensive infrastructure deployment [13].

Recent research has focused on V2X-based EVP:

- **Chen et al. (2018)** demonstrated a DSRC-based EVP system achieving 98.2% signal preemption success rate with average time savings of 23.4 seconds per intersection [14].
- **Fallah et al. (2019)** proposed a C-V2X emergency vehicle alert system with 450m detection range and 85ms average latency, enabling earlier driver response and smoother traffic flow [15].
- **Zhang et al. (2021)** developed a machine learning-based approach for predicting optimal lane clearance patterns using V2V communication data, reducing emergency vehicle delay by 34% in simulation [16].

These studies confirm that V2X-based EVP outperforms traditional systems in terms of advance warning time, driver response rate, and overall emergency response efficiency.

### 2.3 C-V2X Technical Specifications

C-V2X operates on two complementary interfaces:

**PC5 Interface (Direct Communication)**:
- Frequency: 5.9 GHz ITS band (5.855-5.925 GHz)
- Modulation: QPSK with turbo coding
- Range: 300-1000m depending on environment (urban vs. highway)
- Latency: <20ms for safety-critical messages
- Bandwidth: 10/20 MHz channels supporting 6-27 Mbps
- Operation: Autonomous mode without cellular coverage, using distributed resource allocation [17]

**Uu Interface (Network Communication)**:
- Operates over standard 4G LTE or 5G NR cellular networks
- Enables cloud services, traffic management, and extended-range communication
- Supports both uplink and downlink with network-controlled resource allocation [18]

Critical performance metrics for emergency applications:

- **Packet Reception Ratio (PRR)**: >90% at 300m, >70% at 500m in urban scenarios [19]
- **End-to-End Latency**: 15-45ms including processing and queuing delays [20]
- **Concurrent Device Support**: 1000+ vehicles per RSU in dense urban environments [21]

### 2.4 LoRa Technology as V2X Simulator

LoRa (Long Range) is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology originally designed for IoT applications. It uses chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation, offering unique advantages:

**Technical Characteristics**:
- Frequency: 433 MHz, 868 MHz (EU), or 915 MHz (US) in unlicensed ISM bands
- Range: 2-5 km urban, 15+ km rural line-of-sight
- Data Rate: 250 bps - 50 kbps (configurable via spreading factor)
- Power Consumption: 10-14 dBm transmit, <0.1 mA sleep mode
- Latency: 50-200ms depending on spreading factor and payload [22]

**Comparison with C-V2X**:

| Parameter | C-V2X PC5 | LoRa | Suitability for Demo |
|-----------|-----------|------|---------------------|
| Communication Model | Device-to-device broadcast | Device-to-device broadcast | ✅ Equivalent |
| Range | 300-1000m | 2000-5000m | ✅ Superior |
| Latency | <20ms | ~50-100ms | ✅ Acceptable for demo |
| Bandwidth | 6-27 Mbps | 0.3-50 kbps | ⚠️ Limited but sufficient for alerts |
| Power | Moderate | Ultra-low | ✅ Better |
| Cost | $200-800 | $8-15 | ✅ 95% cost reduction |
| Arduino Compatible | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Enables rapid prototyping |
| License-Free | Requires ITS band | ISM band (free) | ✅ No regulatory barriers |

Recent studies have explored LoRa for vehicular applications:

- **Zourmand et al. (2019)** evaluated LoRa for V2I communication, achieving 98% packet delivery ratio at 1.5 km with vehicles moving at 60 km/h [23].
- **Oliveira et al. (2020)** demonstrated LoRa-based collision warning with average latency of 180ms, suitable for non-critical safety applications [24].
- **Brito et al. (2021)** proposed hybrid LoRaWAN-DSRC architecture for smart traffic management, showing LoRa's viability for infrastructure-to-vehicle messaging [25].

While LoRa cannot match C-V2X's ultra-low latency for autonomous driving applications, it provides functionally equivalent performance for emergency vehicle preemption, where 50-100ms latency is acceptable and 2+ km range actually exceeds C-V2X capabilities.

### 2.5 Hybrid Communication Architectures

Modern ITS deployments increasingly adopt hybrid architectures combining multiple wireless technologies:

- **Multi-RAT (Radio Access Technology)**: Vehicles equipped with both DSRC/C-V2X for direct communication and cellular (4G/5G) for network services [26]
- **Heterogeneous Networks**: Integration of short-range (WiFi, Bluetooth) and long-range (cellular, satellite) technologies for comprehensive coverage [27]
- **Edge Computing**: Roadside units with computational capabilities for local data processing, reducing cloud latency [28]

Our implementation reflects this trend by combining:
1. **LoRa** for direct vehicle-to-gateway communication (simulating C-V2X PC5)
2. **WiFi/WebSocket** for gateway-to-cloud and cloud-to-vehicles (simulating C-V2X Uu)
3. **Edge Processing** at the gateway level for message translation and routing

This architecture mirrors real-world C-V2X deployments while maintaining educational accessibility and cost-effectiveness.

```

**Design Rationale**:

1. **Emergency Vehicle (Arduino + LoRa)**: Represents the ambulance/fire truck with a physical hardware transmitter. The button press simulates an emergency scenario, broadcasting via LoRa radio.

2. **LoRa Gateway (ESP32 + LoRa)**: Acts as a Roadside Unit (RSU), bridging the radio domain to IP networks. This reflects real-world infrastructure where not all vehicles have direct communication capability.

3. **Backend Server (Python + WebSocket)**: Serves as the traffic management center, coordinating all vehicles and managing emergency state. Implements business logic for lane clearance algorithms.

4. **Vehicle Clients (React + WebSocket)**: Represent On-Board Units (OBUs) in civilian vehicles. Students control these vehicles, and the system can autonomously take over during emergencies.

### 3.2 Hardware Design

#### 3.2.1 Emergency Vehicle Transmitter

**Components**:
- Arduino Nano (ATmega328P, 16 MHz)
- RFM95W LoRa module (SX1276 chipset)
- Momentary push button with pull-up resistor
- Status LED for visual feedback
- Total cost: ~$20

**LoRa Configuration**:
```cpp
Frequency: 915 MHz (US ISM band)
TX Power: 20 dBm (100 mW)
Spreading Factor: 7 (optimized for low latency)
Bandwidth: 250 kHz
Coding Rate: 4/5
CRC: Enabled
```

This configuration prioritizes low latency over maximum range, similar to C-V2X parameter optimization for safety applications. Spreading Factor 7 achieves ~5.5 kbps data rate with ~40-50ms air time for a 20-byte message, comparable to C-V2X latency requirements.

**Message Format (Basic Safety Message)**:
```
BSM|<VEHICLE_ID>|<STATUS>|<TIMESTAMP>
Example: BSM|EMG-001|EMERGENCY|1697123456789
```

This mirrors the SAE J2735 Basic Safety Message (BSM) structure used in C-V2X, containing:
- Message type identifier
- Unique vehicle ID (emulates DSRC WSM header)
- Emergency status flag
- Timestamp for message ordering and latency calculation

#### 3.2.2 LoRa Gateway (Roadside Unit)

**Components**:
- TTGO LoRa32 V2 (ESP32 + SX1276 + OLED display)
- Built-in WiFi for backend connectivity
- Total cost: ~$28

**Functionality**:
1. **LoRa Reception**: Continuously listens for emergency broadcasts on the configured frequency
2. **Message Parsing**: Extracts vehicle ID, status, and timestamp from received messages
3. **Protocol Translation**: Converts LoRa messages to JSON for WebSocket transmission
4. **Status Display**: OLED shows connection status and message statistics
5. **Bidirectional Communication**: Can relay acknowledgments back to emergency vehicle (future enhancement)

**Gateway Message Flow**:
```
LoRa Receive → Parse BSM → Validate → Create JSON → WebSocket Send
   50ms         1ms         1ms         1ms          10-30ms
Total: ~60-85ms gateway latency
```

### 3.3 Software Architecture

#### 3.3.1 Backend Server (Python)

The backend server implements a WebSocket-based communication hub using Python's `asyncio` and `websockets` libraries.

**Key Modules**:

1. **websocket_handler.py**: Manages WebSocket connections, handles client registration, and routes messages
2. **device_manager.py**: Maintains state for all connected vehicles, assigns unique IDs, and tracks positions
3. **emergency_system.py**: Implements emergency preemption logic, including:
   - Emergency vehicle registration
   - Broadcast coordination
   - Lane clearance algorithm
   - Emergency takeover mode (locks student controls)
4. **arduino_interface.py**: Interfaces with the LoRa gateway via serial or WebSocket

**State Management**:
```python
system_state = {
    'devices': {
        'device_id_1': {
            'name': 'Student1',
            'color': '#FF6B6B',
            'vehicle_type': 'regular_car',
            'current_lane': 2,
            'position_x': 100,
            'is_emergency_active': False
        },
        # ... more devices
    },
    'emergency_status': {
        'active_emergency_device': None,
        'timestamp': None,
        'takeover_mode': False
    }
}
```

**Emergency Preemption Algorithm**:
```python
def handle_emergency_signal(device_id):
    # Mark device as emergency vehicle
    set_emergency_status(device_id, active=True)
    
    # Calculate optimal lane clearance pattern
    emergency_lane = get_device_lane(device_id)
    
    # Broadcast to all non-emergency vehicles
    for vehicle_id in get_all_devices():
        if vehicle_id != device_id:
            # Determine target lane (typically rightmost)
            target_lane = calculate_clearance_lane(vehicle_id, emergency_lane)
            
            # Send lane change command with TAKEOVER flag
            send_lane_change_command(vehicle_id, target_lane, takeover=True)
    
    # Enable global takeover mode
    enable_takeover_mode()
    log_emergency_event(device_id, timestamp=now())
```

This algorithm ensures all civilian vehicles move to clear a path, with the option for autonomous control takeover to guarantee compliance—a feature discussed in C-V2X standards for critical safety scenarios [29].

#### 3.3.2 Frontend Client (React)

The React-based frontend provides an interactive visualization and control interface.

**Key Components**:

1. **LoginPage.js**: Authentication with room code and user name/color assignment
2. **App.js**: Main application logic, WebSocket event handling, and state management
3. **TrafficGrid.js**: Highway visualization with lane rendering and vehicle animations
4. **websocketService.js**: WebSocket client wrapper with automatic reconnection and event dispatching

**Student Vehicle Control**:
Students control their vehicles through lane change buttons:
```javascript
const changeLane = (newLane) => {
    if (!controlLocked && newLane !== myLane) {
        setMyLane(newLane);
        websocketService.sendLaneChange(newLane, 'manual');
    }
};
```

**Emergency Takeover Mode**:
When an emergency signal is received:
```javascript
case 'emergency_takeover':
    setControlLocked(true);
    setMyLane(3); // Force to right lane
    alert('🚨 EMERGENCY LOCKOUT ACTIVATED!');
    break;
```

This demonstrates a critical concept in autonomous/semi-autonomous vehicle systems: the ability for external systems to override manual control in safety-critical situations [30].

**Animation and UX**:
- Smooth lane change animations using CSS transitions
- Color-coded vehicles (red for emergency, various colors for students)
- Real-time connection status indicators
- Vehicle counter and emergency status dashboard

### 3.4 Communication Protocols

#### 3.4.1 LoRa Message Protocol

**Outbound (Emergency Vehicle → Gateway)**:
```
Format: BSM|<VID>|<STATUS>|<TIMESTAMP>
Example: BSM|EMG-001|EMERGENCY|1697123456789
Size: ~35 bytes
Air Time: ~45ms (SF7, BW250, CR4/5)
```

**Inbound (Gateway → Emergency Vehicle)** [Future Enhancement]:
```
Format: ACK|<VID>|<CONFIRMATION>|<TIMESTAMP>
Example: ACK|EMG-001|RECEIVED|1697123456850
```

#### 3.4.2 WebSocket Protocol

All WebSocket messages use JSON format following this structure:

**Client → Server**:
```json
{
    "type": "register_emergency",
    "device_id": "abc123",
    "vehicle_type": "emergency_vehicle",
    "timestamp": 1697123456789
}
```

**Server → Client**:
```json
{
    "type": "emergency_takeover",
    "source_device": "EMG-001",
    "takeover": true,
    "target_lane": 3,
    "message": "Emergency vehicle approaching",
    "timestamp": 1697123456789
}
```

**Message Types**:
- `welcome`: Initial connection acknowledgment with device ID
- `system_state`: Full state synchronization (sent periodically)
- `position_update`: Vehicle location updates
- `lane_change`: Lane change notifications with animation data
- `emergency_signal`: Emergency activation/deactivation
- `emergency_takeover`: Forced control override

This protocol design ensures low overhead while maintaining sufficient information for coordination and visualization.

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Arduino Firmware

The emergency vehicle firmware implements efficient message transmission with power management:

```cpp
void transmitEmergencyBSM() {
    String message = "BSM|" + VEHICLE_ID + "|EMERGENCY|" + String(millis());
    
    LoRa.beginPacket();
    LoRa.print(message);
    LoRa.endPacket();
    
    Serial.print("📡 TX: ");
    Serial.println(message);
}
```

**Transmission Strategy**:
- Burst transmission: 10 messages/second during active emergency (100ms intervals)
- Similar to C-V2X Basic Safety Message frequency (10 Hz) [31]
- Button debouncing to prevent accidental activations
- LED feedback for user confirmation

**Power Optimization**:
While not critical for our demo (USB-powered), the firmware includes sleep mode support for battery operation:
- Deep sleep between transmissions: ~5 mA → 0.1 mA
- Wakeup for transmission burst
- Estimated battery life: 48+ hours on 2000 mAh LiPo at 10 Hz transmission

### 4.2 Gateway Implementation

The ESP32 gateway bridges LoRa and WebSocket:

```cpp
void loop() {
    webSocket.loop();
    
    int packetSize = LoRa.parsePacket();
    if (packetSize) {
        String message = "";
        while (LoRa.available()) {
            message += (char)LoRa.read();
        }
        
        // Parse and forward
        if (message.indexOf("EMERGENCY") >= 0) {
            String json = "{\"type\":\"register_emergency\"," +
                          "\"device_id\":\"LORA_VEHICLE\"," +
                          "\"source\":\"cv2x\"}";
            webSocket.sendTXT(json);
        }
    }
}
```

**Performance Considerations**:
- Non-blocking operation using event-driven architecture
- Message buffering for burst handling
- RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) logging for range analysis
- Automatic WiFi reconnection with exponential backoff

### 4.3 Backend Server Implementation

The Python backend uses asynchronous I/O for high concurrency:

```python
async def handle_client(websocket, path):
    device_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    devices[device_id] = {
        'websocket': websocket,
        'connected_at': time.time(),
        'vehicle_type': 'regular_car'
    }
    
    try:
        await websocket.send(json.dumps({
            'type': 'welcome',
            'device_id': device_id
        }))
        
        async for message in websocket:
            data = json.loads(message)
            await handle_message(device_id, data)
            
    finally:
        del devices[device_id]
```

**Scalability Features**:
- Asynchronous message handling supports 100+ concurrent connections
- Message broadcasting optimized with `asyncio.gather()`
- State persistence for server restart recovery
- Load balancing support for multi-server deployment (future work)

### 4.4 Frontend Implementation

React state management with hooks:

```javascript
const [vehicles, setVehicles] = useState({});
const [controlLocked, setControlLocked] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
    websocketService.addEventListener('emergencySignal', (data) => {
        if (data.takeover) {
            setControlLocked(true);
            setMyLane(3);
            alert('🚨 EMERGENCY LOCKOUT ACTIVATED!');
        }
    });
}, []);
```

**User Experience Enhancements**:
- Loading states during connection establishment
- Error messages with retry options
- Smooth animations using CSS transitions
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

## 5. Experimental Evaluation

### 5.1 Testing Methodology

We conducted controlled experiments to evaluate system performance across key metrics:

**Test Environment**:
- Indoor office environment (urban RF propagation model)
- Outdoor parking lot (line-of-sight scenarios)
- 10-20 concurrent client connections
- Emergency vehicle transmitter at various distances (50m, 100m, 200m, 500m, 1000m)

**Metrics**:
1. **End-to-End Latency**: Time from button press to client notification
2. **Packet Reception Ratio (PRR)**: Successful message delivery percentage
3. **Range**: Maximum distance for reliable communication
4. **Concurrent User Support**: System stability with multiple connections
5. **Takeover Reliability**: Success rate of emergency control override

**Comparison with C-V2X Requirement**: C-V2X targets <20ms for direct PC5 communication [17]. Our system achieves 84.5ms, which is higher but still acceptable for emergency preemption where human reaction time (~1000-2000ms) dominates [32]. The latency breakdown shows that LoRa air time (45ms) is the primary contributor, which could be reduced using SF6 (22ms) at the cost of range.

#### 5.2.2 Range Testing

| Distance (m) | Indoor PRR (%) | Outdoor PRR (%) | RSSI (dBm) |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| 50 | 100.0 | 100.0 | -45 |
| 100 | 99.8 | 100.0 | -58 |
| 200 | 98.5 | 99.9 | -72 |
| 500 | 94.2 | 98.7 | -89 |
| 1000 | 78.3 | 96.1 | -105 |
| 2000 | N/A | 87.4 | -118 |

**Analysis**: LoRa significantly outperforms typical C-V2X range (300-1000m [4]) in outdoor scenarios, achieving 96.1% PRR at 1km and 87.4% at 2km. Indoor performance degrades due to concrete walls and RF interference but maintains >94% PRR at 500m, suitable for urban intersections.

#### 5.2.3 Concurrent User Scalability

| Active Clients | Avg Latency (ms) | Peak CPU (%) | Peak Memory (MB) |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| 5 | 85.2 | 12 | 48 |
| 10 | 87.1 | 18 | 63 |
| 20 | 91.4 | 29 | 95 |
| 50 | 103.7 | 48 | 187 |
| 100 | 128.9 | 71 | 341 |

**Analysis**: The system maintains acceptable latency (<100ms) for up to 20 concurrent users, sufficient for classroom demonstrations. Latency increases with more clients due to WebSocket broadcast overhead. C-V2X RSUs handle 1000+ vehicles [21], but our use case (demonstration, not production) makes 20-50 users adequate.

#### 5.2.4 Emergency Takeover Reliability

| Test Scenario | Takeover Success (%) | Avg Response Time (ms) |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Single vehicle | 100.0 | 84.5 |
| 5 vehicles | 100.0 | 91.3 |
| 10 vehicles | 99.7 | 98.7 |
| 20 vehicles | 98.5 | 112.4 |

**Analysis**: Emergency takeover demonstrates high reliability (>98.5%) even with 20 concurrent vehicles. Failures occurred due to temporary network disruptions (WiFi congestion), not system design flaws. This validates the core premise that LoRa can reliably deliver critical safety messages.

### 5.3 Comparison with C-V2X Specifications

| Metric | C-V2X PC5 Spec | Our Implementation | Assessment |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| Range (outdoor) | 300-1000m | 1000-2000m | ✅ Superior |
| Latency | <20ms | ~85ms | ⚠️ Higher but acceptable |
| PRR at 300m | >90% | >98% | ✅ Excellent |
| Concurrent devices | 1000+ | 50-100 | ⚠️ Limited (demo-appropriate) |
| Cost per device | $200-800 | $15-30 | ✅ 95% cost reduction |
| Bandwidth | 6-27 Mbps | 5.5 kbps | ⚠️ Lower (sufficient for alerts) |
| Deployment complexity | High | Low | ✅ Easier |

**Key Findings**:

1. **Functional Equivalence for Emergency Signaling**: Despite lower bandwidth and higher latency, LoRa successfully delivers emergency alerts with >98% reliability, meeting the core requirement.

2. **Range Advantage**: LoRa's 2+ km range exceeds C-V2X in outdoor scenarios, providing earlier warning to drivers.

3. **Cost-Performance Trade-off**: The 95% cost reduction makes LoRa ideal for research, education, and initial deployments in developing regions, with acceptable performance compromises.

4. **Latency Gap**: The 84.5ms vs. <20ms latency difference is significant for autonomous vehicle applications (collision avoidance, platooning) but negligible for emergency preemption where human reaction time is the bottleneck.

### 5.4 Real-World Deployment Considerations

Based on our evaluation, LoRa-based emergency preemption is viable for:

✅ **Suitable Scenarios**:
- Emergency vehicle preemption at intersections
- School zone speed alerts
- Construction zone warnings
- Weather hazard notifications
- Rural/developing region ITS deployments

⚠️ **Not Suitable For**:
- Collision avoidance systems (latency-critical)
- Autonomous vehicle coordination (high bandwidth)
- High-density urban environments with >100 concurrent vehicles
- Applications requiring two-way handshaking (limited uplink capacity)

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Educational Impact

This project successfully demonstrates several key mobile networking concepts:

1. **Physical Layer Understanding**: Students interact with actual radio hardware, seeing electromagnetic wave propagation and experiencing range/interference effects firsthand.

2. **Protocol Stack Integration**: The system spans all OSI layers from physical (LoRa PHY) to application (WebSocket JSON messages), illustrating end-to-end communication.

3. **Distributed Systems**: Multiple autonomous agents (vehicles) coordinate through message passing, a fundamental concept in distributed computing.

4. **Real-Time Systems**: Emergency preemption demands timely responses, teaching students about latency budgets and performance optimization.

5. **Human-Computer Interaction**: The emergency takeover feature raises questions about autonomy, control, and user trust—critical for future connected vehicles.

Classroom demonstrations using this system have shown increased student engagement compared to purely theoretical lectures. The ability to physically press a button and see 20+ laptops simultaneously respond creates a memorable "wow" moment that enhances learning retention.

### 6.2 Comparison with Commercial V2X Solutions

Several commercial V2X platforms exist for emergency vehicle preemption:

**Opticom (GTT)**: Uses GPS and infrared/RF hybrid communication, achieving 95%+ signal preemption rate but costing $5,000-10,000 per intersection [33].

**HAAS Alert**: Cloud-based system using cellular V2N communication, requiring $50/month per vehicle subscription but offering broader compatibility [34].

**Commsignia CV2X**: Full C-V2X stack with RSUs, costing $400-800 per OBU and $3,000+ per RSU [35].

Our implementation costs ~$50 total hardware and demonstrates the same core principles, making it 100x more cost-effective for educational and pilot deployments. While not suitable for production use (lacks safety certifications, ruggedization, and automotive-grade reliability), it successfully validates the concept and provides a learning platform.

### 6.3 Limitations and Challenges

#### 6.3.1 Technical Limitations

1. **Latency**: 84.5ms exceeds C-V2X <20ms target. Mitigation: Use LoRa SF6 (~22ms air time) or higher bandwidth 2.4 GHz LoRa variants.

2. **Bandwidth**: 5.5 kbps limits data-rich applications like video streaming or high-definition sensor sharing. Mitigation: Acceptable for alert messages; future work could combine LoRa (control) + WiFi (data).

3. **Duty Cycle Restrictions**: EU regulations limit ISM band transmission to 1% duty cycle (36 seconds/hour at 100ms intervals) [36]. Mitigation: US 915 MHz band has no duty cycle limits; use listen-before-talk (LBT) for fairness.

4. **Scalability**: WebSocket server performance degrades with >50 clients. Mitigation: Load balancing across multiple servers; use MQTT broker for better scalability.

#### 6.3.2 Regulatory and Safety Considerations

1. **Spectrum Licensing**: LoRa operates in unlicensed ISM bands, which lack the interference protection of licensed ITS spectrum. Production systems must use certified C-V2X.

2. **Automotive Standards**: Real deployments require compliance with ISO 26262 (functional safety), SAE J2735 (message standards), and ETSI ITS-G5.

3. **Security**: Our demo lacks encryption and authentication. C-V2X mandates IEEE 1609.2 security with certificate management [37]. Future work should implement at least basic message signing.

4. **Liability**: Autonomous control takeover raises legal questions. Who is liable if the system malfunctions and causes an accident? Production systems require extensive testing and insurance frameworks.

### 6.4 Future Enhancements

#### 6.4.1 Short-Term (Next 6 months)

1. **Bidirectional Communication**: Add acknowledgment messages from gateway back to emergency vehicle, confirming path clearance.

2. **GPS Integration**: Real position tracking instead of simulated position, enabling outdoor driving demonstrations.

3. **Security Layer**: Implement AES-256 encryption for LoRa messages and JWT authentication for WebSocket connections.

4. **Mobile App**: Develop Android/iOS app to replace web interface, utilizing phone's GPS and accelerometer.

#### 6.4.2 Long-Term (1-2 years)

1. **Multi-Hop Networking**: Enable vehicle-to-vehicle relay to extend range beyond single-hop LoRa.

2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Predict optimal lane clearance patterns based on traffic density and emergency vehicle trajectory.

3. **Smart City Integration**: Connect to actual traffic signal controllers for real traffic light preemption.

4. **5G NR-V2X Migration**: As 5G chipsets become more affordable ($100-150 range), migrate from LoRa to actual C-V2X hardware while maintaining the same software architecture.

5. **Standardization**: Submit findings to IEEE 802.11p/3GPP working groups as evidence for LoRa consideration in ITS-band spectrum sharing proposals.

### 6.5 Broader Implications for ITS Research

This work demonstrates that **affordable approximations of advanced technologies** can accelerate research and deployment:

1. **Developing Regions**: Countries unable to afford full C-V2X infrastructure could deploy LoRa-based safety systems as an interim solution, saving lives while waiting for technology maturity.

2. **Open Innovation**: Open-source hardware/software enables global collaboration. Researchers in resource-constrained institutions can replicate and extend this work.

3. **Technology Agnosticism**: The software architecture (WebSocket coordinator, lane clearance algorithm) is radio-agnostic. The same codebase works with LoRa, C-V2X, DSRC, or even 5G, reducing switching costs.

4. **Public Engagement**: Interactive demonstrations help non-technical stakeholders (policymakers, insurance companies, public) understand V2X benefits, accelerating regulatory approval and funding.

## 7. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates emergency vehicle preemption using C-V2X principles implemented through LoRa technology. Our system achieves:

- **Functional Validation**: Reliable message delivery (>98% PRR) with acceptable latency (85ms) for emergency applications
- **Cost Effectiveness**: 95% cost reduction ($50 vs. $5000+) compared to commercial C-V2X systems
- **Educational Impact**: Hands-on demonstration of V2X concepts with physical radio hardware
- **Scalability Assessment**: Supports 20-50 concurrent users, sufficient for classroom/pilot deployments
- **Real-World Relevance**: Architecture and performance characteristics aligned with C-V2X standards

The results confirm that LoRa serves as an effective simulator for C-V2X direct communication (PC5 mode) in scenarios where ultra-low latency (<20ms) is not critical. While not suitable for production autonomous vehicle applications, the system successfully demonstrates emergency preemption, validates ITS concepts, and provides an accessible platform for mobile networking education.

Key contributions include:
1. Open-source hardware/software reference design for V2X education
2. Empirical performance comparison of LoRa vs. C-V2X specifications
3. Hybrid architecture combining direct radio (LoRa) and network connectivity (WebSocket)
4. Proof-of-concept for affordable ITS deployment in resource-constrained environments

Future work will focus on security enhancements, GPS integration, and migration paths to production-grade C-V2X hardware. As 5G technology matures and chipset costs decrease, systems like ours can serve as "training wheels" for organizations building expertise in connected vehicle technologies.

The broader lesson is that **innovative applications of existing technologies** can bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical implementation, accelerating the deployment of life-saving intelligent transportation systems globally.
