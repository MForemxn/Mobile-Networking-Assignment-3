```
🌎 United States, Canada, Australia:     915 MHz ✅
🌍 Europe, UK, India:                    868 MHz ✅
🌏 Asia (varies):                        Check local regs!

ALL THREE COMPONENTS MUST BE SAME FREQUENCY!
- Transmitter LoRa: 915 MHz
- Gateway LoRa: 915 MHz (TTGO also 915)
- They won't talk if frequencies don't match!
```
